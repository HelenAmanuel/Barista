# Barista
Welcome to The Gardner Roasting Co. where users can enter their name and drink order. Once their order is placed, it is sent to the back-end where the barista receives the order and clicks on it when it is completed. Once complete, the app will read out loud, `${Customer}, your ${order} is ready.`
